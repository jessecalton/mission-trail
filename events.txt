Events With Options

1. You walk past airbnb and they have a special yurt sweat lodge event. Are you down?

- I've got time to sweat it out.
  - RESULT: You take off your outer garments and enter the steamy yurt and immediately see your coworker in a trance chanting in Tibetan.

- Yurts are cool, but a tent with hipsters doesn't sound kosher.
  - RESULT: You take a big whiff of too cool for schoolness and keep on.

- I think I'll keep my shirt on and keep walking.
  - RESULT: You feel a wave of guilt and call your friend later that evening and plan a 2 week trip to the desert to live with real live Native Americans.

2. The newest coding bootcamp, 'Love Yourself First, Code Second' is having its grand opening. Interested?

- Sure, I've always dreamt of making beautiful things.
  - RESULT: You sign up on the spot and post on Facebook that you are now a junior developer.

- Hell yes. A program like this might get me promoted at Starbucks.
  - RESULT: Your dream is squashed when you realize there is actually a tuition to pay.

- Probably too advanced for me. I'll stick with my Commodore 64.
  - RESULT: You find out that you have been cryogenically frozen for over two decades. That's cold, Jack.
